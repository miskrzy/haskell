# haskell
some chosen haskell tasks from category theory course:
 - task 1: returning a list of all input list's permutations
 - task 2: Foldable and Show instancing of created tree datatype
 - task 3: implementation of list via binary tree
 - task 4: posible positions of chess' knight after n moves, using bind operation
 
To test the programs open the script using ghci (Glasgow Haskell Compiler's interactive environment) and type the functions with parameters functions.
